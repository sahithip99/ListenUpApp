  <h5 class="TOSCategory">Privacy</h5>
        <p>
        Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make
        important disclosures about how you can use ListenUp
         to share with others and how
        we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read
        the Privacy Policy and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5 class="TOSCategory">Sharing Your Content and Information </h5>
        <p>You own all of the content and information you post on ListenUp
            , and you can control
        how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
        </p>

        <p>• For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos (IP
        content), you specifically give us the following permission,
        subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant
        us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-
        free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post
        on or in connection with ListenUp
         (IP License). This IP License
        ends when you delete your IP content or your account
        unless your content has been shared with others, and they
        have not deleted it. </p>
        <p>• When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying
        the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand
        that removed content may persist in backup copies for a
        reasonable period of time (but will not be available to
        others). </p>
        <p>• When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it
        means that you are allowing everyone, including people off
        of ListenUp
        , to access and use that information, and to
        associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture). </p>
